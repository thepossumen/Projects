highly ambiguous. it is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. for these reasons, machine learning architectures for nlp

discrete, structured, and highly ambiguous. it is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. for these reasons, machine learning architectures for nlp applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. the course covers the following broad areas: \u2022working practically with text data, including

not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. for these reasons, machine learning architectures for nlp applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. the course covers the following broad areas: \u2022working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as tokenization and word counting; \u2022probabilistic models for text, such as topic models; \u2022overview of the most common types of nlp applications; \u2022architectures for representation in nlp models, including word embeddings,

highly ambiguous. it is extremely diverse: not only are there thousands of languages in the world, but in each language there is substantial variation in style and genre. furthermore, many of the phenomena encountered in language follow long-tail statistical distributions, which makes the production of training data more costly. for these reasons, machine learning architectures for nlp applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. the course covers the following broad areas: \u2022working practically with text data, including fundamental tasks such as tokenization and word counting; \u2022probabilistic models for text, such as topic models; \u2022overview of the most common types of nlp applications; \u2022architectures for representation in nlp models, including word embeddings, convolutional and recurrent neural network, and attention models; \u2022machine learning models for common types of nlp problems, mainly categorization, sequence

economic theory and empirical methods to analyse different economic problems. this is primarily done by applying the material from previous courses at both the introductory and intermediate level. the idea is that one should get an insight into how economists actually work with both models and empirical methods to understand and analyse a complex reality. the course contains both mico- and macro economic questions. the micro economic questions relate to how individual actors, such as individuals and firms, for example value different good or how they behave under different market conditions. questions that could be discussed range from demand for local environmental quality, or what pricing strategy a firm should use. the macro economic questions concern how factor at an aggregate or societal level relate to each other. examples of questions include what factor explain the economic growth for a country such as sweden over a longer time period, or how does the relationship between unemployment inflation evolve over time. at least one question will relate to sustainability.\npassage: course code: ne0505, course content the purpose of the course is to provide the students with
