more costly. for these reasons, machine learning architectures for nlp applications tend to be quite different from those used in other fields. the course covers the following broad areas:

what pricing strategy a firm should use. the macro economic questions concern how factor at an aggregate or societal level relate to each other. examples of questions include what factor explain the

opportunities involved in being active on a global scale. topics covered include driving forces of internationalisation, the economic and political world order, and international environment analysis. participants are also introduced to international companies' strategic and organizational problems, where concrete issues such as the dilemma of local adaptation and global integration, handling of knowledge transfer, and cross-cultural communication are analyzed and discussed. the module particularly emphasizes strategic and organizational challenges of swedish firms when establishing activities in asia, especially india and china. the international development module (2 hec) discusses the extensive, continuously occurring processes of change in globalised industry in a historical

these systems for current ethical questions, linguistic understanding, reasoning, and communication, and the production and establishment of knowledge in society and scientific domains. the course
