# Projects
Collection of reports (and some code) from assignments and projects.

## RAGsyllabi
- Group project for 4 weeks in the course *Machine learning for Natural Language Processing*.
- Created a RAG-system for asking questions about course syllabi.
- Experimented with different Huggingface models using Google Colab
- Worked with quantized models

## Using sparse phone location data to estimate traffic volume and traffic speed
- Group project for 8 weeks in the course *Project in Data Science*
- Used commercial dataset gathered through a large number of different apps and app categories.
- The dataset:
  - 2.5 million location trajectories that intersect Gothenburg city.
  - 13.5 million time-stamped location data points
  - Between June and December 2019
- Used open-source tools and Python libraries:
  - QGIS
  - Shapely
  - GeoPandas

## Topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet allocation and Gibb's sampling
- Group assignment for 2 weeks in the course *Machine learning for Natural Language Processing*.
- Modelled topics in "The 20 newsgroups text dataset" from scikit-learn.
- LDA assumes that topics are characterized by a distribution of words, and that each document is a blend of such distributions.
- Gibb's sampling approximates the posterior distribution of latent topics for LDA.

## Predicting diabetes diagnose from physiological data
- 4 week group project in the course *Statistical methods for data science*
- Described data, clean data, plotting distributions, fitting PDFs, Q-Q plots, hypothesis testing, predictive analysis with Gaussian Naive Bayes classification and logistic regression classification.
